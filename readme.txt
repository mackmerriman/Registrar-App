Throughout this assignment, I worked alone, so I contributed every part 
of the assignment. This included *.py and the readme. All
solutions coded are my own. A lot of my code is based off of code
shown in lecture by Dr. Dondero.

I did not receive any help on this assignment from others.

While doing the assignment, I utilized sources such as the lecture slides,
Google searches, lecture sample code, and prior knowledge.

I probably spent about 4 hours completing this assignment.

Ive never used Bootstrap before, so it was very helpful to learn
how to use it for the future. I also didn't realize how easy it was
to implement a live updating webpage with each keystroke, which
was satisfying and helpful to learn. Fianlly, this was my first
experience using jQuery, I enjoyed using it.
