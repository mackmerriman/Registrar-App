Throughout this assignment, I worked alone, so I contributed every part 
of the assignment. This included *.py and the readme. All
solutions coded are my own. A lot of my code is based off of code
shown in lecture by Dr. Dondero.

I did not receive any help on this assignment from others.

While doing the assignment, I utilized sources such as the lecture slides,
Google searches, lecture sample code, and prior knowledge.

I probably spent about 7 hours completing this assignment.

I've had a bit of experience with HTML/Javascript, but I found Flask
to be fun and very useful to learn. Creating a mini app like this
felt good and I enjoyed it.
